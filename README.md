# A simple blog

Jul 2022

A simple blog. There is a compose function, and those posts are save to a database and rendered on the home page. It has a contact form that will email and and about page.

The pages render dynamically.

- Front-end: EJS
- Back-end: Node
- Database: MongoDB with mongoose

**Other Notes:**

There seems to be an issue with multiple posts and the footer kinf of floating over them.

The CSS style was imported from the bootcamp I am part of with changes to color and small things by me.
